# Promises 

1. Promise is an asynchronus call in JavaScript and is just like a real world promise.

2. You make a promise (object), and the promise will have two result, either *fulfilled* or *broken*.

3. Eg: When we book a CAB, driver promises to pick us up, If he arrives, promise is fulfilled (.then), but it can happen that the driver,
   got into something and couldn't make it, so now the promise is broken (.catch). Either way we get to know what happened to the Promise.
