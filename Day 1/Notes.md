# Learning JS day 1

## New things I learned today

* typeof *null* is **Object**
* typeof *array* is **Object**
* In JS arrays are Objects.

## Assignment 2 

I had to display my name in 5 fonts (h1 to h5) at runtime. So I had 2 methods:

1. use *getElementById()* so in our .html page I have to name all 5 elements with different ID name and call the method 5  
   5 times in JS.

2. Shortcut is instead of calling 5 times, we can call a method * var x = document.getElementsByClassName("demo")*.
   Now, this method gives all the element by the class name "demo" in an array.
   We can access these by saying *x[0]*, *x[1]*....
